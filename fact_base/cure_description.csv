cultural control,"Before planting, try to ensure that the seeds are disease-free. This is the best method to avoid initial infection and further spread of infection. Using sanitized tools will significantly reduce the chance of bacteria distribution from plant to plant while working with crops. Avoid the use of sprinkler irrigation as sprinklers increase the amount of splashing water amongst crops. This is a major factor in limiting the spread of bacteria between plants. Spacing plants properly is another way to reduce the amount of water splashing from plant to plant. If soil is too wet, improving soil drainage can be very useful to prevent further development and spread of the disease. Removing infected plants is another crucial way of hindering disease expansion. Lastly, crop rotation is should always be considered after dealing with infected crops as it can reduce the chance of crop diseases developing next season.",Pesticide
